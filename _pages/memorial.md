Arrive at 6:30, 6:40 start.

The memorial ceremony is a way to honor the deceased and to help protect them wherever they are going. This ceremony is distinctly Buddhist. If you're interested in attending you're encouraged to participate in the full thing, though it is not required. 

The ceremony will include:

* [Full prostrations](https://austinzencenter.org/full-prostration/) towards an altar
* Offerings of flower petals or incense
* Chanting the [Dai Hi Shin Darani](https://www.sfzc.org/files/daily_sutras_Dai_Hi_Shin_Darani), an ancient Buddhist invocation in Sino-Japanese. An intention of the chant is to provide compassion and protection. The full translation has been lost to time. 
* More prostrations

## Memorial starts at 6:40pm

If you'd like to attend please give yourself enough time so that you can be at the proper location on the beach for the start.
