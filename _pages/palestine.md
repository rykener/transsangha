Trans sangha is in fierce and loving solidarity with the Palestinian people and their calls for an end to the genocide, an arms embargo, an end to the Israeli occupation, and the right of the Palestinians to return to their homeland. The Buddhaâ€™s teachings on compassion, right action, doing no harm, and ending suffering for all beings are in wholehearted alignment with the liberation of Palestine, Lebanon, Sudan, Congo, Tigray and all oppressed people worldwide. 

Our practice can give us the courage and fortitude to open our hearts to our own suffering and the suffering of others. We do not live individual lives, and our own freedom as trans people is bound up in the freedom of all other beings. 

Your grief and anger are welcome in our sangha. We know that some practitioners, particularly SWANA (Southwest Asian and North African) folks, have been both directly and indirectly pushed out of western Buddhist sanghas for expressing grief and anger in response to genocide. These stories are heartbreaking to hear, and we do not participate in shaming or silencing these very justified expressions of human emotion. May we support you in holding all parts of your experience.

May we continue to take action to end suffering for all beings.  
May we continue to build together towards collective liberation.  
May all people experience complete and total freedom.   
May all beings be well, at ease, and may all beings be free.
