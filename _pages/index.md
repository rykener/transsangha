ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¸ Trans Sangha is in solidarity with Palestine. [Read more](/palestine). 

Trans Sangha fosters trans community grounded in mutual aid while following in the tradition of the Buddha. We run a meditation and discussion group every Thursday that focuses on the intersection of Buddhism, meditation, trans issues, and community care. We are also building a mutual aid network to support each other through illness, injury, surgery, and other life changing circumstances.

## Facilitators

The group is co-facilitated by a rotating group trans of Buddhists who practice in a variety of traditions. 

We are not Buddhist teachers.

## Meditation Style/Instruction

The meditation instructions we give in the group is based on or inspired by Shikantaza (Just Sitting), the traditional meditation practice of Soto Zen, or in the style of the Insight/Vipassana tradition. You are not required to meditate in these traditions in order to participate. All we ask is that you remain silent during the meditation period. 

Guided meditation is provided on ðŸŸ¡ Sangha Night, where as meditation is fully silent on ðŸ”· Buddha Night.

If you would like to receive more in-depth meditation instruction please let one of the facilitators know. Meditation should be inclusive, and we will attempt to adapt the instruction to any specific needs.


## Affiliation
