## Updates

<img src="images/signal.png" alt="signal app logo" width="100px"/>

We use a read-only Signal group to send updates to interested people. If you have Signal downloaded you can [use this link](https://signal.group/#CjQKICYH4BMbBk2x0wwIzPQT26q-4Bv-f8yC493EyGR5WMuyEhCEzV1c3QgZEuN1McLCru51) to add yourself to the group.

The Signal group is *not* a group chat.

Signal is a security-focused, open-source chat application similar to WhatsApp but not owned by a billionaire. It's commonly used in both trans and activist circles for organizing and just plain texting. You can download Signal for [iPhone here](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/signal-private-messenger/id874139669) or [Android here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thoughtcrime.securesms).
