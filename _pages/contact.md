This is *not* a group chat.

Signal is a security-focused, open-source chat application similar to WhatsApp but not owned by a billionaire. It's commonly used in both trans and activist circles for organizing and just plain texting. 

We send updates to this chat to remind people about upcoming meetings as well as to make relevant announcements. It's relatively low noise.
