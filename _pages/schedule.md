### 游리 Sangha Night

游리 Sangha Night is a community building focused evening and includes 25 minutes of guided meditation, introductions, a short talk, and community discussion. If you'd like to stick around and chat, we share a snack outdoors afterwards.

Sangha Night is the 2nd and 4th Thursdays of the month.

### 游댯 Buddha Night

游댯 Buddha Night is a silent meditation focused evening. Exact format is TBD, but won't include a talk or discussion. We share a snack outdoors afterwards.

Buddha Night is the 1st and 3rd Thursdays of the month.

<!-- We start with introductions, proceed to have two periods of meditation, which are fully silent, have some light body movement, and finally a community member will share a reading. -->

### 游릭 Dharma Night 

游릭 Dharma Night will be different each time it comes around. It will involve a concentrated look at a Buddhist text, a ceremony of some sort, or anything else that feels relevant. 

Dharma Night is on the 5th Thursdays, which happens every couple months.
