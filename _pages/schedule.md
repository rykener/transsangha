## Location

[SF LGBT Center](https://www.sfcenter.org/) is located at [1800 Market St](https://maps.app.goo.gl/4sThaKXq8nbWWsN39) at the intersection of Market and Octavia in an iconic purple building. We meet in room 204, the "Blue Room." When you enter you can ask for directions to "Trans Sangha" from the reception desk and they'll help you get to the right meeting room.

Masks are not required in the SF LGBT Center but ARE REQUIRED when entering our meeting space.

With deep gratitude we thank San Francisco Zen Center for providing us with this space while the temple we typically meet in is under renovation.
