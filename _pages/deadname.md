# Deadname Ceremony - October 31 @ 7p

## [View the Ceremony Script](/documents/deadname24.pdf)

The Deadname ceremony is a time to reflect on, process, love, and release our past while in community. You need not to have changed your name in order to participate, the ceremony is adaptable to all. 

The ceremony involves setting up a space of protection, invoking and summoning spirits that have unfinished business (such as our pre-transition selves), offering nourishment and protection to those spirits, and then sending them on their way. It's very halloween appropriate. 

During the ceremony folks will have an opportunity to write something down on a piece of paper that they're working with releasing. This could be your old name, old pronouns, old life, old relationship, old concepts, deceased friends of family, or just whatever really. 

The first portion of the evening will focus on studying the text and the ceremony. The second half will be performing the ceremony together, outdoors. 

The ceremony itself is based on a text known as The Gate of Sweet Dew or the Kan Ro Mon. This is an ancient Buddhist text said to have originated from Shakyamuni Buddha himself. As Buddhism traveled around the world in the last 2500 years this text, and it's related ceremony, have changed and been adapted to various needs. The version we're left with today is deeply influenced by Tantric, Chan, and Zen Buddhism, though the echos go beyond.

When Maezumi Roshi, a teacher from Japan, transmitted this teaching to Bernie Glassman Roshi, in America, he cited how various cultures throughout history have changed it, and encouraged Glassman to change it and make it relevant for America today. Trans Sangha has adapted this ceremony so our community can enjoy the benefits of it in a way that is relevant to our lives. Ceremonies are for humans, so it's good to make them fit! 

I hope you'll join us for what will be an interesting night!
