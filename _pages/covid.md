## Covid Protocols

### K/N95 Masks and Vaccines Required!

KN95 or N95 are required when attending Trans Sangha. Cloth masks and surgical masks are not permitted. We mask as an act of community care & to make this space accessible to and inclusive of sangha members who are disabled, chronically ill, and/or immunocompromised.

If you suspect you are sick (Covid or not), please do not attend. 

## Accessibility 

This is a **scent-free** space. Please do not arrive wearing perfume, cologne, heavily scented laundry detergent, or smelling of smoke. People who do not follow this guideline may be asked to leave. 

The temple is located on a moderately steep San Francisco hill. There are no steps to access the meeting space, making it more or less wheelchair accessible. The space is not ADA compliant and a few spots are hard to navigate in a wheelchair, but it is doable (a member of the community who uses a wheelchair has made it work). However, due to ongoing construction in the building, the only available restrooms are outdoor portapotties that can only be accessed by going up a couple steps.

If you have any other accessibility needs, please reach out to us. We want this space to be accessibile to those who want to join.  

## Meditative Accessibility

All bodies are different and not everyone is physically comfortable sitting on a cushion on the ground for extended periods of time. For this reason, we encourage people to meditate how they feel most comfortable: lying down, in a chair, or on a traditional cushion. You are welcome to move and change your position at any point during the meditation.
